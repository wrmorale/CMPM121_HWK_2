This scene depicts a nameless survivor down on their luck as the cabin in the woods 
they are using in the woods to hide from the zombies. Unfortunately it looks like they 
caught up to them, and thus the survivor decided to take matters into his own hands. 
I included objects like forest scenery as well as some rocks, for the cabin I looked 
up an asset of a beat up looking cabin and found a whole asset pack that fit the theme 
I was looking for. I was mostly inspired by the season and the game I am currently 
playing "Darkwood", I felt thatas Halloween was coming up, I thought it appropiate 
to create a scene that reflected the holiday mood. The main character of the scene is 
the zombie entering the survivor's cabin.
